TODO for dj dash

DJ Dash TO DO

* pass url from liq to now playing
** DONE  rrsearch liq telnet cmds
** DONE  decide: either get liquidsoap to pass it thru to icecast, or blow off using icecast for now playing
** DONE more test data
** DONE throw some test posts at it, see how it handles
*** NOWHERE fix bug: title only somewhere in the munging before broadcast
	huh, it fixed itself? spooky...
** DONE http.post inside log2_metadata (why not)
** DONE  remove now playing polling from djdash
** DONE write http listener to grab the json
** DONE how to push to now playing agent? action-at-a-distance, or async chan?
** test djdash with fake dummy data gleaned from ls logs on prod server
** DONE what does the parsed data need to look like?
*** DONE live/not live
	pass thru
*** DONE title
	pass thru, or if empty, mangle from filename
	and LIVE shows have no title, just an artist
*** DONE artist
	pass thru, but if live, add - description if not nil (ugly), otherwise mangle from filename.
	old archives HAVE NO ARTIST but a title
*** DONE url
	pass thru
** improve test cases
** DONE add the munging/parsing to the url handling
** DONE pass it thru the async chan to nowpplaying agent
** DONE add to json/jsonp that dbene uses
** DONE matrix posting will be broken, needs to be fixed too.
*** DONE know what? don't break the API. munge playing properly, the old fashioned way.
** NOWHERE mod the cljs in now playing in djdash 
** DONE mod the js in now playing in spaz radio
** fucking liquidsoap
*** DONE is being a pain in the ass
